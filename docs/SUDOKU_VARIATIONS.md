# 25 Sudoku Variations 🎯

Sudoku has evolved into countless exciting variations. Here are 25 popular ones:

## **Classic Variations**

### 1. **Classic 9x9 Sudoku**
The original! Fill a 9×9 grid so each row, column, and 3×3 box contains digits 1-9.

### 2. **Mini Sudoku (4×4 or 6×6)**
Smaller grids perfect for beginners. 4×4 uses digits 1-4, 6×6 uses 1-6.

### 3. **Mega Sudoku (16×16)**
Uses digits 0-9 and letters A-F. Four times larger than classic Sudoku.

### 4. **Samurai Sudoku**
Five overlapping 9×9 grids forming an X pattern. Solve all five simultaneously!

## **Diagonal & Shape Variations**

### 5. **Diagonal Sudoku (X-Sudoku)**
Classic rules PLUS both diagonals must contain 1-9.

### 6. **Windoku (Hyper Sudoku)**
Adds four extra 3×3 highlighted regions that must also contain 1-9.

### 7. **Asterisk Sudoku**
Nine shaded cells forming an asterisk pattern must also contain 1-9.

### 8. **Center Dot Sudoku**
The center cell of each 3×3 box forms an additional constraint region.

## **Inequality & Comparison Variations**

### 9. **Greater Than Sudoku (Futoshiki-Sudoku Hybrid)**
Inequality signs (< >) between cells show which number must be larger.

### 10. **Killer Sudoku**
Cages with sum totals replace some clues. Fill grid so cages sum correctly.

### 11. **Consecutive Sudoku**
Bars between cells indicate consecutive numbers (like 3-4 or 7-8).

### 12. **Non-Consecutive Sudoku**
Adjacent cells (horizontally/vertically) cannot contain consecutive numbers.

## **Arithmetic Variations**

### 13. **Mathdoku (KenKen)**
Cages contain math operations (×, +, −, ÷). Fill grid so operations work.

### 14. **Product Sudoku**
Cages show the product of numbers inside (e.g., "20" could be 4×5 or 2×2×5).

### 15. **Sum Sudoku**
Similar to Killer but with different cage shapes and rules.

## **Color & Pattern Variations**

### 16. **Color Sudoku (Rainbow Sudoku)**
Nine colors replace numbers. Each color appears once per row/column/box.

### 17. **Even-Odd Sudoku**
Shaded cells must contain even numbers; unshaded must be odd.

### 18. **Thermo Sudoku**
Thermometer shapes: numbers increase from bulb to end.

### 19. **Arrow Sudoku**
Circled cells equal the sum of cells along the arrow.

## **Advanced Logic Variations**

### 20. **Anti-Knight Sudoku**
Cells separated by a chess knight's move cannot contain the same digit.

### 21. **Anti-King Sudoku**
Cells separated by one diagonal step (like a chess king) cannot match.

### 22. **Jigsaw Sudoku (Irregular Sudoku)**
3×3 boxes are replaced with irregular shapes (still 9 cells each).

### 23. **Chaos Sudoku**
No 3×3 boxes at all! Only row and column constraints apply.

## **Multi-Grid Variations**

### 24. **Gattai-8 (Flower Sudoku)**
Eight grids arranged in a flower pattern with overlapping sections.

### 25. **Sohei Sudoku (Shuriken Sudoku)**
Four grids overlap in a pinwheel/ninja star pattern.
